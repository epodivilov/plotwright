# Plotwright

Plotwright is a meta-framework for end-to-end testing, built on top of Mountebank and Playwright. It simplifies the process of setting up, configuring, and running tests, while providing a more convenient API and offering base classes for PageObjects and PageElements. The goal of Plotwright is to help developers write clear, readable, and maintainable tests with ease.

The name "Plotwright" is a combination of the words "plot" and "wright." A plot refers to a story or sequence of events, which can be seen as a metaphor for a test scenario. A wright, on the other hand, is a worker or craftsman, such as a playwright who crafts stories for the stage. In this context, Plotwright can be understood as a tool that helps developers craft their test scenarios.
